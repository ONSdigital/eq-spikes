The `questionnnaire.json` file describes how we might represent a questionnaire as produced by the authoring application and sent to the survey runner platform.

The `run.py` file contains pythiogn code which closely, but not exactly reflects the json file.  The core concepts of the json file are all present and working.

You can run the questionnaire with the following command;

`python run.py`
